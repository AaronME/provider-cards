A couple of things that are not layed out in the provider template stuff:


- `find/replace` of provider-template needs to include folder/filenames as well as contents
- repo name needs to be updated everywhere (imports, apigroup, etc)
- aliases may or may not need to be updated. Personal preference.
- apiGroup needs to be updated across the board.


Developer guide:

- The kubebuilder create api command that is suggested has some undesirable behavior:
    - we need to create a PROJECT file https://book.kubebuilder.io/reference/project-config.html
    - it returns an error-- AND creates files
    - It creates files under `api` instead of `apis`
- reference to link that has been removed? "[What Makes a Crossplane Managed Service]."


TODO(@aaronme):
    provider-cards does not need to deal in "cards" internally. (It will, don't worry).
    It need to store a deck state in a configMap or Secret.
    This is the "deck."
    It then needs to offer "card" access to that configMap or Secret.


    # We're offering an API to a ConfigMap stored in the cluster.
    Deck:
        The deck knows how many cards are in the "deck."
        When we take a card, the deck knows we took it but not where it went.
        So we need a function for taking a card from the "deck."
        

        Okay... so we create a list and an index (1-52).

    - Create will populate the ConfigMap with cards in order.
    - We can call Shuffle on that deck (this is an Object?)
    - We can create a Deal object with a "secret" target.
